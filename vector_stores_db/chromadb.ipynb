They learn to predict outcomes based on this labeled information.\\n* **Unsupervised learning:** Algorithms analyze unlabeled data and try to find hidden patterns, structures, or relationships within it (e.g., grouping customers based on purchasing behavior).\\n* **Reinforcement learning:**  Algorithms learn by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties for their actions (e.g., training a robot to navigate a maze).\\n\\n**Real-world applications:**\\n\\nMachine learning is used in countless areas, including:\\n\\n* **Image recognition:** Identifying objects, faces, and patterns in images.\\n* **Natural language processing:** Understanding and generating human language.\\n* **Predictive analytics:** Forecasting future trends based on historical data.\\n* **Recommendation systems:** Suggesting products or content to users based on their preferences.\\n* **Fraud detection:** Identifying suspicious transactions or activities.\\n* **Medical diagnosis:** Assisting doctors in diagnosing diseases based on patient data.\\n\\n**Benefits of Machine Learning:**\\n\\n* **Automation:** Automating tasks and processes that would otherwise require human intervention.\\n* **Improved accuracy:** ML algorithms can often outperform humans in specific tasks, especially when dealing with large datasets.\\n* **Personalization:** Delivering customized experiences for users based on their individual preferences.\\n* **Innovation:** Enabling new discoveries and solutions across various industries.\\n\\n\\n**In short:** Machine learning is a powerful tool that allows computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without explicit programming, leading to significant advancements in various fields. \\n', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'model': 'gemma2:2b', 'created_at': '2025-11-18T13:48:49.4219971Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 37618674400, 'load_duration': 23984851000, 'prompt_eval_count': 14, 'prompt_eval_duration': 684000000, 'eval_count': 473, 'eval_duration': 12939000000, 'model_name': 'gemma2:2b', 'model_provider': 'ollama'}, id='lc_run--dfda7d0a-0914-4cf5-91b7-57a8f5cffff4-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 14, 'output_tokens': 473, 'total_tokens': 487})"

       "AIMessage(content='Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves the use of algorithms and statistical models to enable machines to learn from data, make decisions, and improve their performance over time. The primary goal of machine learning is to enable machines to automatically improve their performance on a task without being explicitly programmed.\\n\\nMachine learning involves training a model on a dataset, which allows the model to learn patterns and relationships within the data.
